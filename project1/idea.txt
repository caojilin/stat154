Its a machine learning class project where we were given real world biology data. As we expected, the data were totally a mess. I and my partner spent lots of time on data cleaning. After that we drew a lot of graphs hoping to extract meaningful information. Since the data we were labeled, we only used unsupervised learning methods and linear regression. We wrote a formal 10-page research paper report. Its my first time to write such a paper. I exercised my analysis skills as well as data manipulation skills.
